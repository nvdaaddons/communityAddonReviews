* [ ] Coding style: this review is ideal for add-ons that the community believes should become part of the NVDA screen reader in the future. This is because the core code in NVDA is held to a high standard, and your core contribution will be subjected to harsh constructive criticism to ensure quality.
* [ ] Python 3 compatibility: this is best for add-ons that   will be useful  for a long time (past 2020).
* [ ] GUI: for add-ons that present dialogs and windows. This review looks at control spacing, window placement and other graphical elements. Note: Review availability is subject to availability of non-blind contributors.
* [ ] Translation: a user who speaks another language will be asked to review add-on messages in hopes of helping you make your messages easier to understand and translate. We will also comment on how to utilize NVDA's translation system.
* [ ] NVDA feature compatibility: for add-ons that may extend NVDA features or add features from newer releases to older NVDA versions.
